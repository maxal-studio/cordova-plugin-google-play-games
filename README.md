### Authentication

Returns the current authentication status via an AuthenticationResult.

If a sign-in flow is currently in progress (such as the automatic sign-in attempt during game start), delivery of this call's result will be postponed until the current sign-in attempt has completed.

This API is useful for understanding if your game has access to Play Games Services. This method should be called when your game starts in order to conditionally enable or disable your Play Games Services integration.

```javascript
import * as GooglePlayGames from "cordova-plugin-google-play-games";
let { id } = await GooglePlayGames.isAuthenticated(); // userId returned
```
